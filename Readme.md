# Elm-Sweeper rewritten in Typescript

Discontinued, uploaded for a friend.

## Ideas to differentiate from Hexcells

- Longer text available for custom rules
- "Literate" collections of Puzzles
- Ability to mark regions
- Find "Objects" hidden below hexes
- Use "keys" to unlock additional clues. Choose wisely.
    (It will be hard to write a solver for this one)
    (You could get different grades for hard levels this way.)
- Random level generator with seed sharing and rating.
- Ability to shift a row, this would update the captions
    (Provides a lot of additional information)
- Monster Sweeper Version

## Quality of life ideas
